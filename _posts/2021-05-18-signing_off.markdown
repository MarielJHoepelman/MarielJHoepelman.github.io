So apparently I’m graduating soon. I have one more assessment to go and that is it. 
I’m going to be candid here for those that read these blogs. It was way way way harder than I thought. So, for this final blog I will talk about my overall experience with the program.

The process of getting into the program was not hard because I was already learning to code (for fun) when I started. So when I was sent the trial lessons, I completed them with no issues. When I started the actual program, I had a lot of time in my hands, but not too long after that everything changed. My kids' school schedule changed, my job schedule changed, I had to move twice and at the same time the program was getting harder and harder. 

Since the program I am in is self paced. Motivation was a huge issue because at any moment I got to choose not to do a lab, or not to read a lesson, and personal struggles with mental and physical health did not help either. So a 10 months program became a 3 years program. 

Looking at the lessons/labs that I had left to finish the program was not helpful whatsoever. I was having a hard time seeing how much was still ahead. So I decided I would not check the progress anymore and that I would do a little every day, as much as I could. Some days I did 2 lessons and others 8 and one day without noticing I completed my last lesson!

My favorite part of the program was the test driven labs and labs that included images of the expected outcome. The resources links at the bottom of each lesson were also very helpful. Learn overall is easy to navigate, visually pleasant and has a lot of great features like the lessons/labs completed counters and log. 

My biggest issue with the program is the assessment requirements. They seem to me a little unrealistic and sometimes far reaching. I mean, a Twitter clon? An Imgur clon?!?

Other issues I encounter are that some of the lessons/ labs are out of order where some labs appear first in the curriculum before the lessons that teach how to work on those labs. Some labs wont connect to their corresponding repositories and many do no get the submitted status when submitted even with all the tests passing.  

One of my least favorite things about the program was writing these blogs. Writing is not something I’m good at and even worse if it's in English (English is not my first language which I'm sure if you got to here you already noticed). I do understand the benefit of writing blogs, but I certainly did not enjoy it. 

So the last thing to say is thank you to Flatiron for the opportunity to be part of this program, it has been a challenging experience but a rewarding one as well. I am impressed with all the things I know in comparison to what I knew when I started. 

To the students that are starting or maybe are not new but are struggling, you can do this. Please know everyone's timing is different. Not everyone can do things at the same pace. Some people learn faster, or have less responsibilities, or a better health status, but your time will come too. This is not forever. Take it step by step...one lesson at a time. They add up. Focus on what you have completed already and how much you have learned rather than what is still ahead.  And if you are new and you haven’t completed any lessons, you already decided to be here and did whatever you had to do to be here, and that is already something to be proud of. 

Good luck everyone!
