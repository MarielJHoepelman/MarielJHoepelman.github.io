My interest in coding started around two years ago.  Feeling the need to learn something new, something exciting and outside of my field of work lead me to here. A little background before the real deal, I studied psychology (oriented to neuroscience). I’m currently working as a behavioral assessor at a hospital for identifying high risk behaviors in patients at risk for contracting HIV. 

The hospital I work at serves an underprivileged/underrepresented population, because of that, our patients have lots of needs and need a lot of support. As important and rewarding as this job is, is also very draining. It usually leaves me with little to none energy or desire to talk to my family and friends about their problems or even my own. After many stories, hundreds of assessments later, I found myself feeling bad about my patients’ situations, good about my life and then guilty about having such a nice life while others struggle so badly.

In terms of my professional growth, I was no longer interested in pursuing an advanced degree in my field. I didn’t want to further invest in a career that was not making me feel good or at least “ok.” I mean, who wants to settle for feeling “okay” in a place one spend 8 hours a day at? The salary is another whole story, the human service field is very underpaid and very competitive for women since is female dominated. 

So going back to coding, my husband whom is a Software Engineer, talked to me about an online platform for learning to code, self-pace (not Flatiron). At the moment, I had downtime at work, and said to myself why not? After trying this online program for a little while I found myself interested; not to a point of considering a career switch, but to the point of feeling challenged in a different way. It gave me the opportunity to understand a little bit more about my husband’s work. This new knowledge opened a new channel of communication between us, so now I could talk to him about my job and he could talk to me about his and I could have an idea of what he was talking about (a very very basic very vague idea). 
I heard about Flatiron from him as well. He volunteered as a teacher assistant for an event in which his coworker was teaching. He was at the moment looking into teaching part-time (pssst Flatiron, he still is!) I looked into it and landed in Code with Klossy website and later heard about the Women Take Tech scholarship with BirchBox and applied to it not thinking I would get it… well I got it. 

With that opportunity at hand I decided to take the scholarship and give it a try. My experience so far has been very challenging, much much much more that I was expecting, let’s just say Imposter Syndrome hit me hard, it hit me like a plane crash in my brain but that’s a topic for another blog post (hopefully not).
After years of working in the human services field I finally concluded that I no longer wish to do the work I do for a living, is no longer rewarding to me neither financially nor professionally. So I decided to give the technology field a full try this time, and use my knowledge about human behavior to make myself understand I can do this even if my brain tells me otherwise.
